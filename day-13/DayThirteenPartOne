# Plan


Final problem:
	What is the fewest number of tokens required to win all possible prizes?


Breaking the problem down:
	- Button A requires 3 tokens

	- Button B requires 1 token

	- There are some machines that cannot win, so this means that we have to determine all possible combinations of A and B
	up to a certain point (that point being that we go over either the X or the Y coordinate the prize is locatied at)
		NOTE: there are definitely more ways to optimize this. I don't know off the top of my head right now.

	- Given a machine can win (we don't know initially so have to keep trying until we exceed a threshhold of some sort) 
	we need to find the smallest number of tokens per machine to win (so smallest # of tokens for machine 1, machine 2, ...)

	- Sum up the (smallest) number of tokens it took to win all winnable games.


Proposed Solution:

	1. Determine how to win a single game (if possible).

	2. Determine if a game is not winnable.

	3. Determine how to win a single game (if possible) in the shortest amount of tokens.

	4. Count up all the tokens used (should be the minimum possible) and display on screen.
